# 🏛 CivicHelp Platform

CivicHelp is a secure, SLA-driven civic issue reporting platform that enables citizens to report public problems,
authorities to manage and resolve them, NGOs to collaborate, and administrators to monitor system performance
through analytics and dashboards.

This project was built to demonstrate **real-world backend system design**, not just CRUD APIs.
